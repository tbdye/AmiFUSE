# Performance

## Policy

Performance numbers are only comparable within the same fixture recipe.
Ad hoc timings from a hand-maintained demo disk are useful for smoke
checks, but long-run regression tracking should move toward generated
fixtures with controlled:

- filesystem type
- image size
- file count
- directory count
- file size distribution
- fill percentage
- read-only vs read-write mode

For the current rebased `amifuse-0.5` line, the historical PFS
traversal baseline remains `0.6s`.

## Current Matrix

The first integration runner is [`tools/amifuse_matrix.py`](/Users/stepan/git/AmiFuse-codex/tools/amifuse_matrix.py).
It runs repeated smoke checks against canonical fixtures in
`~/AmigaOS/AmiFuse/` and times:

- inspect
- handler init
- root enumeration
- one known-path `stat`
- one small-file read
- one larger-file read
- flush/unmount preparation

Writable fixture runs add:

- directory create
- file create
- file write
- rename
- remount
- post-remount verify
- delete
- cleanup flush

Format fixture runs add:

- image creation
- filesystem format
- first post-format mount
- writable smoke on the fresh volume
- remount verification after format

The harness now defaults to `3` runs per fixture and reports:

- per-operation median times
- total time as `min / median / max`

The initial canonical set is:

- `PFS3`: `pfs.hdf` with `pfs3aio`
- `SFS`: `sfs.hdf` with `SmartFilesystem`
- `FFS`: `Default.hdf` with `FastFileSystem`
- `OFS`: `ofs.adf` with `FastFileSystem`
- `BFFS`: `netbsdamiga92.hdf` with `BFFSFilesystem`
- `CDFileSystem`: `AmigaOS3.2CD.iso` with `CDFileSystem`

This is the current all-green aggregated read-only matrix for the
expanded canonical fixture set. The earlier single-run table overstated
drift, especially for `PFS3`, because its totals were too noisy to
compare from one sample.

`BFFS` now uses the NetBSD fixture directly in the default read-only
matrix. The key compatibility fix there was making AmiFuse-generated
BSTRs safe for handlers that temporarily treat counted strings as
NUL-terminated C strings.

## Latest Writable Run

Run:

```sh

```

Date: `2026-04-04`

The writable smoke tests use scratch copies under
`~/AmigaOS/AmiFuse/generated/`, seeded from the canonical fixtures.

This is the first all-green writable smoke matrix across `OFS`, `FFS`,
`PFS3`, and `SFS`. Bringing `SFS` into this matrix exposed and fixed a
real post-startup compatibility bug: child processes were not preserving
their own blocked wait state or register set, so they never resumed when
port traffic arrived after startup.

## Latest Format Run

Run:

```sh
python3 tools/amifuse_matrix.py --fixtures ofs-fmt ffs-fmt pfs3-fmt sfs-fmt --runs 3
```

Date: `2026-04-04`

The format smoke tests create fresh generated RDB images under
`~/AmigaOS/AmiFuse/generated/`, format them through AmiFuse, then mount
them read-write, create and rename a file, remount, verify the contents,
delete the test file, and flush again.

One runtime quirk matters here: `SFS` crashes if the formatter bridge is
driven through a post-format uninhibit cycle after `ACTION_FORMAT`
already succeeded, while classic DOS filesystems still need that
uninhibit before the next mount sees a usable freshly formatted volume.

## Large Image Smoke

Run:

```sh
python3 tools/amifuse_matrix.py --fixtures pfs3-4g --runs 1 --json
```

Date: `2026-04-04`

This is the first ephemeral `>4GB` smoke case. It creates a sparse `5GiB`
RDB image, places a small `PFS3` partition at byte `4,644,864,000`, formats
that partition, writes deterministic data, remounts, reads it back, verifies
it, and then removes the image immediately after the run.

| FS | Status | Image size | Partition start | Create img | Inspect | Format | Init | Root | Mkdir | Create | Write | Rename | Flush | Remount | Verify stat | Verify read | Delete | Cleanup flush | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PFS3 >4G` | `ok` | `5GiB sparse` | `4,644,864,000` | `0.090s` | `0.001s` | `0.078s` | `0.062s` | `0.007s` | `0.016s` | `0.020s` | `0.015s` | `0.019s` | `0.002s` | `0.074s` | `0.012s` | `0.024s` | `0.011s` | `0.002s` | `0.434s` |

This case is intentionally not part of the default matrix run. It is meant to
exercise large-offset image I/O without keeping a persistent multi-gigabyte
fixture on disk.
